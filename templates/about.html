  <p><b>1. Pick a destination.</b></p> 
  <p>Try your current location or anywhere you'd like to go.</p>

  <p><b>2. Meet the locals.</b></p>
  <p>Discover who you're connected to in that destination.</p>

  <p><b>3. Explore your connections.</b></p>
  <p>Reconnect with old friends and meet new ones through your network. Reach out directly or get introduced by a mutual friend.</a></p>

  <p><b>Your Experience is Powered by Your Network.</b></p> 
  <p>The more friends you invite to Dazy the more local connections you will see.</p>
