<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>
<strong>With whom we share your information</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
o Information Shared with Other Users. When you register as a user of the Service, your profile will be viewable by other users of the Service. Other users
will be able to view information you have provided to us directly or through Facebook, such as your Facebook photos, any additional photos you upload, your

</p>
<p>
§ <strong>Service providers. </strong>We may share information, including personal and financial information, with third parties that perform certain
services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales
analysis, ad tracking and analytics, member screenings, supporting our Service functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other

</p>
<p>
§ <strong>Other Situations. </strong>We may disclose your information, including personal information:
</p>
<p>
§ In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement entity or other government
agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive
any legal objection or right available to us.
</p>
<p>
§ When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected

applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies.

We also may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, with third parties, including advisors,
advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis or other business purposes. For example, we may engage a data provider
who may collect web log data from you (including IP address and information about your browser or operating system), or place or recognize a unique cookie
on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content. The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you
voluntarily have submitted to us (such as your email address), that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. To opt-out
of cookies that may be set by third party data or advertising partners, please go to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.

as to prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Use, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Service or our users, or take other actions
otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention
of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies.

<strong>How we protect your personal information</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely secure.
Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats, or other
communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending
personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself

<strong>Information you provide about yourself while using our Service</strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We provide areas on our Service where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others. Such postings are governed by our
Terms of Use. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable pages, that information will be publicly available and can
be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your
posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your
personal information.
